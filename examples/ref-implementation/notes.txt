# Observations on consolidation

- needs to have the DNS name configurable
- has some strong dependencies to gitea that need to be pulled out 
  - how can we do this in relation to other git repositories needs to be determined
- assumes nginx installation (the ref implementation can drop the nginx stuff in)
- needs CSI driver if we want to work with EBS blocks to install posgtress
  - this requires podIdentity or IRSA enabled for EBS blocks
